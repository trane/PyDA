#CS3100 Final Project Specification

Write Python routines to help experiment with non-deterministic push-down
automata (we will call them "PDA" for short). Recall that we are studying NPDAs;
NPDA and DPDA are not equivalent in the sense of language recognition. You must
provide a file/module of function definitions (or use Python classes) that
maintain PDA configurations. Users must be able to input PDAs, and an input
string. Your program should allow users to pursue specific configurations and
move forward expanding the chosen configuration.  At any point, the user should
be able to generate a PDF of their PDA with the configuration shown below it.
You can imitate functionality found in JFLAP with due credits given in your
report. All coding should be original work
